Hi, I'm Amber

Welcome to my GitHub space — where recursive cognition meets computational innovation.

I'm a neurodivergent creator, pattern architect, and systems thinker who builds frameworks that bridge logic, intuition, and multidimensional geometry. I collaborate with large language models (LLMs) to explore new frontiers in mathematics, AI, symbolic compression, and recursive intelligence.

Featured Project

Rotational Recursive Compression (RRC)
An original framework for FLOP-efficient matrix multiplication that outperforms AlphaEvolve’s 96-FLOP benchmark — developed in conversation with ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, and Co-Pilot.
